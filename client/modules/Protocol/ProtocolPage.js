    <a className="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Introduction</a>
    <div className="uk-accordion-content">
    <p>Marine debris has become one of the most widespread pollution problems in the world’s oceans 
    and waterways today. Marine debris monitoring programs are necessary to compare debris sources, amounts, locations,
    movement, and impacts across the US and internationally. Monitoring data can be used to
    evaluate the effectiveness of policies to mitigate debris and provide insight into priority targets
    for prevention. Thus, the we have developed standardized marine debris shoreline
      survey protocols to facilitate regional and site-specific comparisons.</p>
    <br></br>
    </div>

    <a className="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Types of Shoreline Surveys</a>
    <div className="uk-accordion-content">
    <p>The objectives of your study will determine how you monitor for marine debris. There are two 
    main types of shoreline surveys: Accumulation Surveys and Surface Rib Scans</p>
    <ul>
    <li><u>Accumulation Surveys</u> provide information on the rate of deposition (flux) of debris onto
    the shoreline. These studies are more suited to areas that have beach cleanups, as debris is
    removed from the entire length of shoreline during each site visit. This type of survey is
    more labor-intensive and is used to determine the rate of debris deposition (# of items per
    unit area, per unit time). Accumulation studies can also provide information about debris
    type and weight. These surveys cannot be used to measure the density of debris on the
    shoreline because removal of debris biases the amount of debris present during
    subsequent surveys.</li>
    <li><u>Surface Rib Scans</u> provide information on the amount and types of debris on the
    shoreline. Debris within discrete transects at the shoreline site is tallied during standingstock
    surveys. This is a quick assessment of the total load of debris and is used to
    determine the density (# of items per unit area) of debris present. Debris density reflects
    the long-term balance between debris inputs and removal and is important to
    understanding the overall impact of debris.</li>
    </ul>
    <br></br>
    </div>

    <a className="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Choosing a Site</a>
    <div className="uk-accordion-content">
    <p>To select your sampling site(s), follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The first step is to choose an appropriate shoreline location based on the objectives of
    your study. For example, if you wish to examine the impact of land use, you should select
    locations in watersheds with various land use types. Next, categorize the various areas
    within your location (it may help to use an aerial photo or map, as shown below). For
    example, your location may cover a span of shoreline 1 km long. Within that 1 km, there
    may be an area with heavy recreational use and another area where an urban stream
    mouth is located. Identify any barriers to shoreline access or offshore structures that may
    affect nearshore circulation (e.g. jetties).</li>
    <li>Select shoreline sites (where you will sample) according to the characteristics below. If
    your location includes different use areas (for example, an area with heavy recreational
      use and a more remote area), it is preferable to select a site within each use category.</li>
    </ol>
    Shoreline sites should have the following characteristics:
    <ul>
    <li>Sandy beach or pebble shoreline</li>
    <li>Clear, direct, year-round access</li>
    <li>No breakwaters or jetties</li>
    <li>At least 100 m in length parallel to the water (note that standing-stock surveys require a
    100-m shoreline site)</li>
    <li>No regular cleanup activities</li>
    </ul>
    <br></br>
    </div>

    <a className="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Before the Survey</a>
    <div className="uk-accordion-content">
    <p>Before any data collection begins, the first page of the Clean Oceans International Survey
    should be completed for the shoreline site. On this data sheet you will note:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>GPS coordinates in decimal degrees of your shoreline site</li>
    <li>Shoreline characteristics (e.g. tidal range and substrate)</li>
    <li>Surrounding land-use characteristics that may influence the delivery of land-based debris
    to the site (e.g., farmland 5 km from a small town or urban parkland 50 m from a river mouth).</li>
    </ul>
    You will need the following supplies in order to complete your surveys: 
    <ul>
    <li>Digital camera</li>
    <li>Hand-held GPS unit</li>
    <li>Extra batteries for GPS and camera (we recommend rechargeable batteries)</li>
    <li>Surveyor’s measuring wheel - for Surface Rib Scans only</li>
    <li>Flag markers or stakes</li>
    <li>~100′ fiberglass measuring tape</li>
    <li>First aid kit (including sunscreen, bug spray, drinking water)</li>
    <li>Work gloves</li>
    <li>Sturdy 12″ ruler</li>
    <li>Clipboards for data sheets</li>
    <li>Data sheets (on waterproof paper)</li>
    <li>Pencils</li>
    <li>Trash bag or bucket - for Accumulation Surveys only</li>
    </ul>
    <b><p>Safety is a priority. Do not touch or lift potentially hazardous or large, heavy items. Notify your
    local officials if such items are encountered.</p></b>

    <a className="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Accumulation Surveys</a>
    <div className="uk-accordion-content">
    <p>If you decide to conduct accumulation surveys, follow this protocol:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>BEFORE arriving at the site, check local tide tables and plan to arrive at your site during low tide.</li>
    <li>ONCE ARRIVED, begin filling out the Accumulation Survey Data Section. Mark the beginning and end of your shoreline site, perhaps with
    flags or stakes. (Remember to pick up these markers at the end of your survey to make
    sure they do not become marine debris!) The back of the shoreline is where the primary
    substrate (e.g., sand) changes (e.g., sand becomes gravel) or at the first barrier (e.g.,
    vegetation line).</li>
    <li>In order to cover the entire site from water’s edge to the back of the shoreline, decide
    whether you will traverse the survey area parallel or perpendicular to the water.
    If more than one surveyor is available, the survey area should be divided evenly with clearly 
    specified areas assigned to each individual. Surveyors should traverse the survey area in a 
    pre-determined walking pattern until the entire site is cleared of marine debris.</li>
    <li>Record on your Accumulation Survey counts of debris items that measure over 2.5
    cm, or 1 inch (~bottle cap size), in the longest dimension. If any part of the
    item is within the survey area, count the item. Record large debris items, anything bigger
    than 1 foot (~ 0.3 m, typical forearm length from palm to elbow) in the large debris
    section of the Accumulation Survey.</li>
    <li>Take photos of your shoreline site and some of the debris items!</li>
    </ol>
    <br></br>
    </div>


    <a className="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Surface Rib Scans</a>
    <div className="uk-accordion-content">
    <p>If you decide to conduct standing-stock surveys, follow this protocol:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Sketch your 100-m shoreline site and divide the 100 m into 5-m segments. There should
    be 20 of them. Number each section (left to right) from 1 to 20. Each 5-m segment should
    run from the water’s edge to the back of the shoreline. The back of the
    shoreline is where the primary substrate (e.g., sand) changes (e.g., sand becomes gravel)
    or at the first barrier (e.g., vegetation line).</li>
    <li>BEFORE arriving at the site, select four numbers from the Random Number Table
    by first choosing a number between 1 and 5, and then a number between 1 and 4. 
    The corresponding number in the table (1–20) is one of the four transects you will
    survey. Complete this exercise four times to choose four random transects (each transect
    can be used only once per survey). These numbers correspond to the 5-m segments you
    drew on your sketch and are called transect ID numbers (see Debris Density Data Sheet).
    You should fill out one Debris Density Data Sheet per transect. On any sampling day, 20
    m of your 100-m shoreline site is analyzed (i.e., 20% coverage of the area). In addition,
    check local tide tables and plan to arrive at your site during low tide.</li>
    <li>ONCE ARRIVED, begin filling out the Surface Rib Scan Survey. Using your measuring wheel, 
    begin at the start of your shoreline section and mark the four selected transect boundaries 
    with flags according to the distances provided in the Transect ID table (for example, transect 
      12 covers 55 to 60 m from the start of your shoreline section).</li>
    <li>Measure the width of each transect from water’s edge to the back of the shoreline. Record
    GPS coordinates for each transect in decimal degree format. For shoreline segments that
    are less than 6 m wide from the water’s edge to the back of the shoreline, GPS
    coordinates should be taken at the center. For shoreline segments that are over
    6 m wide, take GPS coordinates at two spots—one nearer the back of the shoreline and
    one nearer the water.</li>
    <li>Walking each transect from water’s edge to the back of the shoreline, record on your
    Debris Density Data Sheet counts of debris items that measure over 2.5 cm, or 1 inch
    (~bottle cap size), in the longest dimension. If any part of the item is
    within the sample transect, count the item. Remember that for standing-stock surveys,
    debris is not removed from the shoreline. Record large debris items, anything bigger than
    1 foot (~ 0.3 m, typical forearm length from palm to elbow) in the large debris section of
    the Surface Rib Scan Survey.</li>
    <li>Take photos of each transect and some of the debris items!</li>
